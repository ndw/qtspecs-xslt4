         Returns an array containing all the members of a supplied array, plus one additional member at the end.
      filterfilter(array(*), function(item()*) as xs:boolean) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing those members of the $array for which 
            $function returns true.
      flattenflatten(item()*) as item()*
         Replaces any array appearing in a supplied sequence with the members of the array, recursively.
      fold-leftfold-left(array(*), item()*, function(item()*, item()*) as item()*) as item()*
         Evaluates the supplied function cumulatively on successive members of the supplied
            array.
      fold-rightfold-right(array(*), item()*, function(item()*, item()*) as item()*) as item()*
         Evaluates the supplied function cumulatively on successive values of the supplied
            array.
      for-eachfor-each(array(*), function(item()*) as item()*) as array(*)
         Returns an array whose size is the same as array:size($array), in which
            each member is computed by applying $function to the corresponding member of
            $array.
      for-each-pairfor-each-pair(array(*), array(*), function(item()*, item()*) as item()*) as array(*)
         Returns an array obtained by evaluating the supplied function once for each pair of members at the same position in
            the two supplied arrays.
      from-sequencefrom-sequence(item()*) as array(*)from-sequence(item()*, function(item()) as item()*) as array(*)
         Returns an array obtained by evaluating the supplied function once for each item in the input sequence.

         Returns the value at the specified position in the supplied array (counting from 1).
      headhead(array(*)) as item()*
         Returns the first member of an array, that is $array(1).
      insert-beforeinsert-before(array(*), xs:integer, item()*) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of the supplied array, with one additional member at a specified position.
      joinjoin(array(*)*) as array(*)
         Concatenates the contents of several arrays into a single array.
      putput(array(*), xs:integer, item()*) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of a supplied array, except for one member which is replaced with a new value.
      removeremove(array(*), xs:integer*) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of the supplied array, except for the members at specified positions.
      reversereverse(array(*)) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of a supplied array, but in reverse order.
      sizesize(array(*)) as xs:integer

      sliceslice(array(*), xs:integer*) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing the members from a supplied array at given positions,
         counting from either end
      sortsort(array(*)) as array(*)sort(array(*), xs:string?) as array(*)sort(array(*), xs:string?, function(item()*) as xs:anyAtomicType*) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all the members of the supplied array, sorted 
            according to the value of a sort key supplied as a function.
      subarraysubarray(array(*), xs:integer) as array(*)subarray(array(*), xs:integer, xs:integer) as array(*)
         Returns an array containing all members from a supplied array starting at a supplied
            position, up to a specified length.
      tailtail(array(*)) as array(*)
