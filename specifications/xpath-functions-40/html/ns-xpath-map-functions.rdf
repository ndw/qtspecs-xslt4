         Tests whether a supplied map contains an entry for a given key
      entryentry(xs:anyAtomicType, item()*) as map(*)
         Returns a map that contains a single entry (a key-value pair).
      filterfilter(map(*), function(xs:anyAtomicType, item()*) as xs:boolean) as item()*
         Selects entries from a map, returning a new map.
      findfind(item()*, xs:anyAtomicType) as array(*)
         Searches the supplied input sequence and any contained maps and arrays for a map entry with the supplied key,
            and returns the corresponding values.
      for-eachfor-each(map(*), function(xs:anyAtomicType, item()*) as item()*) as item()*
         Applies a supplied function to every entry in a map, returning the concatenation of the
            results.
      getget(map(*), xs:anyAtomicType) as item()*
         Returns the value associated with a supplied key in a given map.
      group-bygroup-by(item()*, function(item()) as xs:anyAtomicType?) as map(*)
         Constructs a map by taking the items in a sequence and grouping on a key that is computed for each item.
      keyskeys(map(*)) as xs:anyAtomicType*
         Returns a sequence containing all the keys present in a map
      mergemerge(map(*)*) as map(*)merge(map(*)*, map(*)) as map(*)
         Returns a map that combines the entries from a number of existing maps.
      putput(map(*), xs:anyAtomicType, item()*) as map(*)
         Returns a map containing all the contents of the supplied map, but with an additional entry, which replaces
         any existing entry for the same key.
      removeremove(map(*), xs:anyAtomicType*) as map(*)
         Returns a map containing all the entries from a supplied map, except those having a specified key.
      replacereplace(map(*), xs:anyAtomicType, function(item()*) as item()*) as map(*)
         Returns a map based on the contents of an existing map, computing a new value to be associated
            with a supplied key.
      sizesize(map(*)) as xs:integer
         Returns the number of entries in the supplied map.
      substitutesubstitute(map(*), function(xs:anyAtomicType, item()*) as item()*) as map(*)
         Applies a supplied function to every entry in a map, returning a map whose entries
         have the same keys as the input, but (potentially) different associated values.
